<h1 style="color:WHITE;">PPG LAB</h1>
<p style="color:WHITE;">Photoplethysmography (PPG) technology is used mainly to develop small, wearable, pulse rate sensors used in smart watches such as Fitbit and Apple Watch. PPGs consist of a light-emitting diode (LED) and a photodetector (PD) to measure changes in light absorption (Fig 1.A). In each cardiac cycle, the heart pumps blood to the periphery; when this pulse reaches the skin, the arteries and arterioles can be distinguished in the subcutaneous tissue. The change in volume caused by the pressure pulse is detected by measuring the amount of light reflected to the photodetector after the skin is illuminated with the LED. The delay between the emission and detection of the light is then used to recreate the pulse signal</p>
  <p>The same technology is also used in proximity sensors in order to detect the proximity of an object. Recent advances in optical technology have facilitated the use of high-intensity green LEDs for PPG technology which catalyzed the adoption of this measurement technique in wearable technology. In this lab, we are interested in developing a wearable Fitness band.</p>
